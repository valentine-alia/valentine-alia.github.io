Here is a work-in-progress collection of my personal projects:


Reference:

- [Review of Calculus for Physics Majors](https://valentine-alia.github.io/calc_review/intro.html)
- [PHY 410 (Statistical Mechanics) Reference Sheet](https://github.com/valentine-alia/valentine-alia.github.io/raw/master/assets/docs/Stat_Mech_Refrence_Sheet.pdf)

Photography:

I'm a birder and one of my hobbies is wildlife photography. See [https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/](https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/) for a gallery of some of my favorite photos I've taken over the years. My instagram is also mostly my photography. 

Music:

I am an amateur musician. Some of my music can be found on my bandcamp here: [https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/](https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/). None of my music is very good but I love playing and writing it. I'm also in the process of creating **Morphism**, the worlds first abstract algebra themed metal band!
