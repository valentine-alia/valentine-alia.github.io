Here is a work-in-progress collection of my personal projects:


Reference:

[PHY 410 (Statistical Mechanics) Reference Sheet](https://github.com/valentine-alia/valentine-alia.github.io/raw/master/assets/docs/Stat_Mech_Refrence_Sheet.pdf)

Photography:

I am an amateur wildlife photographer and wannabe birder. See [https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/](https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/) for a gallery of some of my favorite photos I've taken over the years. My instagram is also home to my photos.

TTRPGs:

I am in the process of making a TTRPG called Renegade. It is all about being on the run in a rich sci-fi world. Feel free to message me for the pdf!

Music:

I am a pretty good bassist and a not so good guitarist. Some of my older music can be found on my bandcamp here: [https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/](https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/). Eventually I will get around to releasing new music.
