Here is a work-in-progress collection of my personal projects:

Photography:

I am an amateur photographer and wannabe birder. See [https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/](https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/) for a gallery of some of my favorite photos I've taken over the years.

TTRPGs:

I am in the process of making a TTRPG called Renegade. It is all about being on the run in a unique sci-fi world. Feel free to message me for the pdf!

Music:

I am a pretty good bassist and a not so good guitarist. Some of my older music can be found on my bandcamp here: [https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/](https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/). Eventually I will get around to releasing new music.
