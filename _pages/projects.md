Here is a work-in-progress collection of my personal projects:


Reference:

[PHY 410 (Statistical Mechanics) Reference Sheet](https://github.com/valentine-alia/valentine-alia.github.io/raw/master/assets/docs/Stat_Mech_Refrence_Sheet.pdf)

Photography:

I am an amateur wildlife photographer and wannabe birder. See [https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/](https://valentine-alia.github.io/photography/) for a gallery of some of my favorite photos I've taken over the years. My instagram is also home to my photos.

TTRPGs:

I am (early) in the process of designing a TTRPG called [Renegade 276T](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjN7UcFsRgjt9069Hh_ez10gdrbD?e=T7yLlA).

Music:

I am a passable bassist and less-passible guitarist. Some of my older music can be found on my bandcamp here: [https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/](https://valentine-alia.bandcamp.com/). Eventually I will get around to releasing new music.
