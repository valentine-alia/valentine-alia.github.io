Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Cornell Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam).

I'm interested in a wide range of problems in Applied Mathematics, my main areas of interest are dynamical systems, numerical analysis, mathematical ecology, and collective behavior. 

Additionally, Physics, Math, and Computaion education is important to me. I spent most of my undergraduate career at Michigan State University working for MSU's [Physics Education Research Lab](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/).


I use she/her/hers pronouns.
