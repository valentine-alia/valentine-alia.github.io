Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a rising senior undergraduate student at Michigan State University studying Mathematics and Physics. I'm also persuing a minor in Computational Mathamatics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE). 

I'm broadly interested in applied mathematics. Right now I'm particularly interested in Dynamical Systems, PDEs and numerical methods for solving differential equations.

Additionally, Math and Physics communication and education is important to me, and accordingly MSU's Physics Education Research Lab ([PERL](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/)) is near and dear to my heart.

 I use she/her/hers pronouns.
