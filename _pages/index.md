Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Cornell Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). I am interested in dynamical systems and collective behavior, especially in biological systems. I love bringing powerful mathematical tools to bear on interesting problems. Before coming to cornell I earned a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Michigan State Unversity. 

I'm also highly motivated by Math, Physics, and Computing education, communication, and outreach. I spent nearly all of my undergraduate career in MSU's [Physics Education Research Lab](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/).

My pronouns are she/her/hers.
