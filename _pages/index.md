Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a senior undergraduate student at Michigan State University studying Mathematics and Physics. I'm also persuing a minor in Computational Mathamatics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE). 

I'm interested in Applied Mathematics, specifically Dynamical Systems and Numerical Analysis in the context of Differential Equations. 

Additionally, Mathematics and Physics communication and education is important to me, and accordingly MSU's Physics Education Research Lab ([PERL](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/)) is near and dear to my heart.

 I use she/her/hers pronouns.
