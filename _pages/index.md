Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a rising senior undergraduate student at Michigan State University studying Mathematics and Physics. I'm also persuing a minor in Computational Mathamatics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE). 

I'm broadly interested in applied math, with particular interest in Dynamical Systems, especially nonlinear systems in biology and physics, as well as numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. 

Additionally, Math and Physics communication and education is important to me, and accordingly MSU's Physics Education Research Lab ([PERL](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/)) is near and dear to my heart.

 I use she/her/hers pronouns.
