Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the [Cornell Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). I am mainly interested in applied dynamical systems/nonlinear dynamics/complex systems. I love bringing all sorts of powerful mathematical tools to bear on problems across the sciences. ODEs, Bayesian methods, numerical analysis, PDEs, TDA, control theory, stochastic processes, etc., I love using them all to tackle interesting problems. Lately I've been particularly motivated by collective behavior and its ties to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics.

I'm also highly motivated by Math, Physics, and Computing education, communication, and outreach. I spent nearly all of my undergraduate career in MSU's [Physics Education Research Lab](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/).

My pronouns are she/her/hers.
