Hello! I'm Alia Valentine.

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Cornell Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). I am a member of the [C³](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/c3groupcornell) group and am advised by [Dr. Anastasia Bizyaeva](https://anastasiabzv.github.io/). I am interested in control theory and dynamical systems, especially in the context of biological systems and collective behavior. I love bringing powerful mathematical tools to bear on interesting problems. Before coming to Cornell I earned a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Michigan State Unversity. 

I'm also highly motivated by Math, Physics, and Computing education, communication, and outreach. I spent nearly all of my undergraduate career in MSU's [Physics Education Research Lab](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/).

My pronouns are she/her/hers.
