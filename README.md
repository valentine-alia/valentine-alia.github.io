## Alia's Notes to self on how to actually use this site

- `-pages` has the markdown files for the main pages that show up on the site. 
- `_posts` has blog posts that show up at https://valentine-alia.github.io/blog/
- `assets` has any useful files like my cv, images, latex notes I've uploaded, etc.
- `navigation.yml` chooses what pages are actually built into the main menu of the site
- `config.yml` has all of the convienient site-wide settings and design stuff
